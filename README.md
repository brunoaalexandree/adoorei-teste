# About this project

This is a project was a test sent by the Adoorei team.

The layout was sent via email, and Figma was used.
Making the project was somewhat challenging, despite a simple layout, but I came across some interesting decision making so that I could faithfully follow the layout.
I started making the project with the Vue CLI. So... it's very simple to install the project.

That's all, folks. ‚ù§
